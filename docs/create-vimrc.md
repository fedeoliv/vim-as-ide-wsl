# Create the vimrc file

Create the `~/.vimrc` file and add the following line:

```vim
set nocompatible
```

The *nocompatble* option turns off the *Compatible mode* (e.g. compatibility with the old *vi*), opening the doors for Vim customizations.

> Assuming this file will be a system-wide vimrc, setting the *nocompatible* option is required. It needs to be set before all other options.
