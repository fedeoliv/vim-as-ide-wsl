# Vim as IDE on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)

This repository contains information about how to install and configure Vim on WSL2, as well as my personal preferences of plugins that I use daily.

## Prerequisites

* Windows 10 with Ubuntu 18.01+ installed via WSL2
* Vim 8.2+ `huge` build + clipboard compiled with Python 3.6+ on Ubuntu. If you don't have it installed or are not sure if these features are enabled, check out the [Installation](./docs/install-vim.md) guideline.

## Configuring Vim

* [Create the vimrc file](./docs/create-vimrc.md)
* [Install Vundle](./docs/install-vundle.md)
* [Share clipboard between Windows and Linux](./docs/share-clipboard-windows-linux.md)

## Tips to make Vim looks good

* [Adding a VSCode Dark+ color scheme](./docs/vscode-dark-color-scheme.md)
* [Write and Preview Markdown files](./docs/markdown.md)
