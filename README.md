# Vim as IDE on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2)

This repository contains information about how to install and configure Vim on WSL2, as well as my personal preferences of plugins that I use daily.

## Prerequisites

* Windows 10 with Ubuntu 18.01+ installed via WSL2
* Vim 8.2+ `huge` build + clipboard compiled with Python 3.6+ on Ubuntu. If you don't have it installed or are not sure if these features are enabled, check out the [Installation](./docs/install-vim.md) guideline.

## General configurations

* [Create the vimrc file](./docs/create-vimrc.md)
* [Install the Vundle plugin manager](./docs/install-vundle.md)
* [Share clipboard between Windows and Linux](./docs/share-clipboard-windows-linux.md)
* [Add the VSCode Dark+ color scheme](./docs/vscode-dark-color-scheme.md)

## Language-specific configurations

* [Add a multi-language graphical debugger](./docs/multi-language-graphical-debugger.md)
* [Write and Preview Markdown files](./docs/markdown.md)
